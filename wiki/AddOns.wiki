#summary Building for Android Add-Ons using Maven Android Plugin

= Introduction =

To Build your android projects which are dependent on Add-Ons such as Google Maps, you need to configure have the maps artifact deployed to your local repository or a repository server you can access (as done by the maven-android-sdk-deployer).

== Additional development setup ==

   # Add one of the following dependency to your project pom.xml depending on which SDK version you are using.

{{{
           <dependency>
              <groupId>com.google.android.maps</groupId>
              <artifactId>maps</artifactId>
              <version>3_r3</version>
              <scope>provided</scope>
          </dependency>

          <dependency>
              <groupId>com.google.android.maps</groupId>
              <artifactId>maps</artifactId>
              <version>4_r1</version>
              <scope>provided</scope>
          </dependency>

          <dependency>
              <groupId>com.google.android.maps</groupId>
              <artifactId>maps</artifactId>
              <version>5_r1</version>
              <scope>provided</scope>
          </dependency>

          <dependency>
              <groupId>com.google.android.maps</groupId>
              <artifactId>maps</artifactId>
              <version>6_r1</version>
