#summary Building for Android Add-Ons using Maven Android Plugin

= Introduction =

To Build your android projects which are dependent on Add-Ons such as Google Maps, you need to configure Maven. 

== Additional development setup ==

   # Add the following dependency to your project pom.xml .

{{{
  <dependency>
    <groupId>add-ons</groupId>
    <artifactId>maps</artifactId>
    <version>3</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
}}}

  This corresponds to the maps.jar file in the $ANDROID_SDK_15/add-ons/google_apis-3/libs which is needed to compile all Android applications using Maps. Install this file to your local repository with the following command.

    {{{ mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=add-ons -DartifactId=maps -Dversion=3 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=$ANDROID_SDK_15/add-ons/google_apis-3/libs/maps.jar}}}

== Issues ==

  Future version of the plugin will automatically take care of the Add-Ons. Please refer the following issue for the details and star it to bump it up the issue stack:
