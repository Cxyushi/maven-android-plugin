== Where can I find the samples? ==

Download the samples directly from github.com, where we host the source code.

--> [http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin-samples/tree/samples-2.0.0-rc1 Browse samples-2.0.0-rc1]

You can download a zip file with all sample code, by following the above link and then clicking the "download" button at the top.

_(If you prefer using git, go ahead, the clone url is behind the link above too.)_

== What are the samples? ==

!ApiDemos is a sample application that comes with the Android SDK.

We have mavenized both the one from Android SDK 1.1 and Android SDK 1.5.

The samples are meant to show you how to create a {{{pom.xml}}} and structure your project to work with Maven Android Plugin.

There are two sets of samples:
{{{
|
+-- apidemos-11
| \
| +--- apidemos-11-app
| |
| \--- apidemos-11-instrumentationtest
|
\-- apidemos-15
  \
  +--- apidemos-15-app
  |
  \--- apidemos-15-instrumentationtest

}}}
 * The directory {{{apidemos-11}}} contains !ApiDemos from Android SDK 1.1
 * The directory {{{apidemos-15}}} contains !ApiDemos from Android SDK 1.5

 * Beneath each of those, are two directories:
   * {{{apidemos-NN-app}}}, which contains a {{{pom.xml}}} and source code for the application apk.
   * {{{apidemos-NN-instrumentationtest}}}, which contains a {{{pom.xml}}} and source code for instrumentation tests of the app.

== How to build the samples ==
If you have set up your development environment according to GettingStarted, you can build for example the !ApiDemos sample from Android SDK 1.5 like this:

 {{{
 cd apidemos-15
 mvn install
 }}}


That should build an apk for the {{{apidemos-15-app}}} project and then an apk for the
{{{apidemos-15-instrumentationtest}}} project. As part of the {{{apidemos-15-instrumentationtest}}}
project, it will deploy both apk files to the connected device or emulator and
run the instrumentation tests.
