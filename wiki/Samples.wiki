== Where can I find the samples? ==

Download the samples directly from github.com, where we host the source code.

--> [http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin-samples/tree/samples-2.1.0 Browse samples-2.1.0]

You can download a zip file with all sample code, by following the above link and then clicking the "download" button at the top.

_(If you prefer using git, go ahead, the clone url is behind the link above too.)_

=== Important notes: ===

 #. Use the above link to get the correct version of the samples! Then you will automatically use a proper released version of maven-android-plugin. If you would use the very latest "master" version of the samples, they will require that you compile the plugin by yourself first. 
 #. Make sure to choose a location with a short path to unzip the package; it has deeply nested structures and you want to stay within the path length limits of your OS. Windows is known to skip some deeply located files when the complete directory path becomes too long.

== What are the samples? ==

!ApiDemos is a sample application that comes with the Android SDK.

We have mavenized both !ApiDemos from Android SDK 1.1 and !ApiDemos from Android SDK 1.5.

The samples are meant to show you how to create a {{{pom.xml}}} and structure your project to work with Maven Android Plugin.

There are two sets of samples:
{{{
|
+-- apidemos-11
| \
| +--- apidemos-11-app
| |
| \--- apidemos-11-instrumentationtest
|
\-- apidemos-15
  \
  +--- apidemos-15-app
  |
  \--- apidemos-15-instrumentationtest

}}}
 * The directory {{{apidemos-11}}} contains !ApiDemos from Android SDK 1.1
 * The directory {{{apidemos-15}}} contains !ApiDemos from Android SDK 1.5

 * Each of those, are split up into two Maven projects:
   * {{{apidemos-NN-app}}}, which contains a {{{pom.xml}}} and source code for the application apk.
   * {{{apidemos-NN-instrumentationtest}}}, which contains a {{{pom.xml}}} and source code for instrumentation tests of the app.

== How to build the samples ==
If you have set up your development environment according to GettingStarted, you can build for example the !ApiDemos sample from Android SDK 1.5 like this:

 {{{
 cd apidemos-15
 mvn install
 }}}

When you build from that directory, you will build both the application project and instrumentation test project. They both generate an apk each.

As part of the {{{apidemos-15-instrumentationtest}}} project, Maven Android Plugin will deploy both apk files to the connected device or emulator and
run the instrumentation tests inside the device.
