#summary About the sample code.

----
<sup>This page refers to a new set of samples which will be released soon, as part of Maven Android Plugin's new Android SDK 1.5 support.</sup>

== Where can I find the samples? ==

Right now, you can download the samples directly from github.com, where we host the source code.

--> [http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin-samples/tree/featurebranch-1.5-support Browse samples]

If you want, you can download a zip file with all sample code, by following the above link and then clicking the "download" button at the top.

== What are the samples? ==

!ApiDemos is a sample application that comes with the Android SDK.

We have mavenized both the one from Android SDK 1.1 and Android SDK 1.5.

The samples are meant to show you how to create a {{{pom.xml}}} and structure your project to work with Maven Android Plugin.

There are two sets of samples:
 * !ApiDemos from Android SDK 1.1 -- the directory {{{apidemos-11}}}
 * !ApiDemos from Android SDK 1.5 -- the directory {{{apidemos-15}}}

In mavenizing the {{{apidemos-*}}} projects, we have done the following with each of them:
 * Restructured subdirectories to fit the default Maven structure.
 * Split it into two projects: the app, and the platformtests.
 * Created a {{{pom.xml}}} for {{{apidemos-NN-app}}} which uses maven-android-plugin to build the apk.
 * Created a {{{pom.xml}}} for {{{apidemos-NN-platformtests}}} which uses maven-android-plugin to build the platformtest apk, install it together with the app's apk to the device and run the tests on device.

== How to build the samples ==
If you have set up your development environment according to GettingStarted, you can build for example the !ApiDemos sample from Android SDK 1.5 like this:

 {{{
 cd apidemos-15
 mvn install
 }}}


That should build an apk for the {{{apidemos-15-app}}} project and then an apk for the
{{{apidemos-15-platformtests}}} project. As part of the {{{apidemos-15-platformtests}}}
project, it will deploy both apk files to the connected device or emulator and
run the platform tests.
