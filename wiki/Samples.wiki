== Where can I find the samples? ==

This link will take you to the correct version:

--> [http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin-samples/archives/samples-2.6.0 Download samples-2.6.0]


=== Important notes: ===

 #. Use the above link to get the correct version of the samples! Then you will automatically use a proper released version of maven-android-plugin. If you would use the very latest "master" version of the samples, they will require that you compile the plugin by yourself first. (Full explanation about correct version is on the [http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/wiki/Source?tm=4 Source] tab.)
 #. Make sure to choose a location with a short path to unzip the package; it has deeply nested structures and you want to stay within the path length limits of your OS. Windows is known to skip some deeply located files when the complete directory path becomes too long.

== What are the samples? ==

!ApiDemos is a sample application that comes with the Android SDK. !HelloFlashlight is the sample application mentioned in the [http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/android-dev.html Android chapter] of the book _Maven: The Complete Reference_.

The samples are meant to show you how to create a {{{pom.xml}}} and structure your project to work with Maven Android Plugin.

For example, the apidemos sample has this structure:
{{{
|
\-- apidemos-15
  \
  +--- apidemos-15-app
  |
  \--- apidemos-15-instrumentationtest

}}}
 * The directory name {{{apidemos-15}}} means it contains !ApiDemos from Android SDK 1.5

 * It is split up into two Maven projects:
   * {{{apidemos-15-app}}}, which contains a {{{pom.xml}}} and source code for the application apk.
   * {{{apidemos-15-instrumentationtest}}}, which contains a {{{pom.xml}}} and source code for instrumentation tests of the app.

The MorseFlash example has a similar structure for a simpler project, which also shows the usage of a release profile to sign and zipalign the Android package.

The scala examples show you how to build an Android application written with the Scala language and how to use Proguard to reduce the size of the resulting package.

== How to build the samples ==

You can build all samples in one go by running 

{{{ 
mvn clean install 
}}}

in the samples root folder. As a prerequisite you have to have an emulator of API level 4 (platform 1.6) or higher running or equivalent device connected. Otherwise the build will try to start an emulator named "16" for you. An Android Virtual Device of that name has to exist for the build to succeed.

You can also run each example separately with the same command. Sample specific documentation can be found in the README.txt file in each project folder.


If you have set up your development environment according to GettingStarted, you can build for example the !ApiDemos sample from Android SDK 1.5 like this:

 {{{
 cd apidemos-15
 mvn install
 }}}

When you build from that directory, you will build both the application project and instrumentation test project. They both generate an apk each.

As part of the {{{apidemos-15-instrumentationtest}}} project, Maven Android Plugin will deploy both apk files to the connected device or emulator and
run the instrumentation tests inside the device.
