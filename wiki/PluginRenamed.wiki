#summary Plugin was renamed to android-maven-plugin.

= What has happened? =

This plugin was recently renamed to *{{{android-maven-plugin}}}*.

= Does it affect me? =
For anyone using version 3.0.0-alpha-11 or greater, *{{{android-maven-plugin}}}* is the name to use. Previous versions will always be available under the old name {{{maven-android-plugin}}}.

= What do I need to do? =
In your Android app projects, change all occurances of {{{maven-android-plugin}}} to *{{{android-maven-plugin}}}*.

If you're on a Unix-like system, this command might work:
{{{
find . -name pom.xml -exec sed -r 's/maven-android-plugin/android-maven-plugin/g' -i {} \;
}}}

= Why? =
Please read [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/maven-android-developers/KS1xPtNlHEk/discussion the discussion thread leading up to the renaming decision].

= TODO =
Here is a list of stuff we need to do to finish the work of renaming the plugin:
 * ~~Update the plugin source code.~~
 * ~~Release the plugin with the old name and a {{{<relocation>}}} configuration.~~
 * ~~Release the plugin with the new name.~~
 * ~~Update the front page of the Google Code project website.~~
 * ~~Update the [Samples] source code.~~
 * Update all relevant pages on the wiki.
 * Update the maven complete reference book chapter - Manfred Moser will work on this.
 * Update the maven archetype.

When one of the above is done, please edit this page and check it off. For wiki edit permissions, please email hugo@josefson.org.
