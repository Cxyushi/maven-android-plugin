#summary Snapshot repo instructions.
#labels Phase-QA

= Introduction =

The snapshot repo may contain pre-releases from time to time. They are for example announced in the Issue tracker, as a comment on an Issue, or on the mailing list Maven Android Developers.

Only use this snapshot repo for testing unreleased versions.



= Details =

In order to use the repository just add the url http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/jayway-snapshots/ as a proxy repository to your repository server and add that repository to your public group.

In case you are still not using a repository server you can add the following to your pom.xml or settings.xml. Keep in mind that this is a discouraged Maven practice though and don't use this as a permanent solution.

{{{
    <pluginRepositories>
        <pluginRepository>
            <id>oss.sonatype.org-jayway-snapshots</id>
            <name>Jayway OpenSource SNAPSHOTs on Sonatype.org</name>
            <url>http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/jayway-snapshots/</url>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </pluginRepository>
    </pluginRepositories>
}}}

With this setup done, you can change the `<version>` tag for the android-maven-plugin you're using in that pom, to the unreleased `*-SNAPSHOT` version you wish to test.
