== General ==

The rule(s) of thumb for naming things in Maven Android Plugin, are:
 * They should reflect the way other things in Maven-world are named.
 * In second hand, when there is no appropriate name for it in Maven-world, use whatever it is called in Android-world.

*Above all:*
 * *It should be very clear what all names mean.*
