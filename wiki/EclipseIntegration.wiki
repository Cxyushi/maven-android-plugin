= Introduction =

Android's official development effort provides solid support for Eclipse integration, and we'd like to make sure maven-android-plugin helps bridge Maven, Android, and Eclipse. This page will help us collect information on what works and doesn't work


= First Glimpse =
== Specs ==
  * Eclipse 3.4
  * maven-android-plugin 2.0
  * android sdk 1.5
  * m2eclipse plugin
== Experience ==
I imported my project from SVN into eclipse using m2eclipse's checkout from SCM tool. It was not recognized as an android project, so I clicked "convert to android project". My R.java file was never generated, leaving me with errors in my source code.

I then added the default.properties to SVN and tried again. This time, my R.java file was populated and I had no source code errors.

The old way of using Eclipse's Run => As Android Project pushed the .apk without the necessary dependencies, and I have not found a method that works inside Eclipse.
