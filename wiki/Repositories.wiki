#summary An incomplete list of repositories with Android related artifacts to be found there..

= Introduction =

Via the dependency mechanism the Android Maven Plugin can automatically retrieve artifacts from remote repositories. By default Maven access the Central Repository http://search.maven.org and it will be detailed the most. Access to others has to be added via using a repository manager like Nexus, Archiva or Artifactory or less ideally an entry in the setttings.xml or worse in the pom.xml.

= Artifacts on the Central Repository =

A whole bunch can be found by just doing a search for the apklib packaging as introduced by the Android Maven Plugin:
