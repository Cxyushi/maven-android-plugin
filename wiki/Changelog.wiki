    ==== _About the Maven Android Plugin versions_ ====

    _Maven Android Plugin was based on the Masa plugins 1.0.0. Thank you to Shane Isbell for creating Masa! (http://code.google.com/p/masa) 

    Maven Android Plugin 1.x is a direct clone of Masa's trunk. It is meant as an easy way for any current user of Masa 1.0.0 to get access to the latest bug fixes in Masa's trunk.

    Maven Android Plugin 2.x has been improved in terms of features, usability and bugfixing, compared to version 1. It is recommended for all new users._

 * More and updated documentation, both wiki and in code.
 * More tests in code.

== Maven Android Plugin 2.0.0-alpha2 ==
 * Doesn't expect PATH to be set too. Uses ANDROID_SDK/tools instead. (fixed in one more place)
 * Split out samples to a separate git repo.

== Maven Android Plugin 2.0.0-alpha1 ==

First release of the new implementation of Maven Android Plugin.

Implemented all changes listed in [http://groups.google.com/group/masa-developers/browse_thread/thread/732fb629ec917cd4 this email with suggestions sent to the Masa Developers list], except number 11 (done as of 2.0.0-alpha3) and number 12 (ongoing as Issue 6 here, please give feedback on that).

Some of the details implemented:
 * Collected all plugins into one, for clarity and maintainability.
 * Refactored *a lot* of code for maintainability and clarity.
 * Separate the act of deploying an apk into a goal of its own ({{{mvn android:deploy}}}).
 * When running the {{{integration-test}}} phase for a {{{<packaging>android:apk:platformTest</packaging>}}} pom, automatically deploy the platform test apk, as well as the apk to test, onto the device before.
 * Optionally undeploy each apk from the device before deploying it. This helps the issue where different developers with different debug keys use the same device and try to install an apk with the same package id. They would collide if the first one is not undeployed before the other is deployed on top of it.
 * Make as much as possible automatically configured, if possible. For example reading the package id from inside an apk file or !AndroidManifest.xml (whichever is available), instead of the user having to define it when for example undeploying an apk.
 * Added a sample Maven application (!ApiDemos) as an example of using Maven Android Plugin, and as a test for the plugin.
 * Improved documentation.
 * Added unit testing.
 * Added error messages.
 * Updated dependencies' versions.
 * Removed the PAR plugin. It can be added again if requested.
 * Fine-tuned phases and made lifecycle more like the default lifecycle for {{{<packaging>jar</packaging>}}}.
 * Renamed many things to names which say what they do.
 * Renamed {{{install}}} to {{{deploy}}}, because that's what it's usually called in Maven-world, and because {{{install}}} has a very specific (other) meaning.
 * Also delete {{{Manifest.java}}} when deleting {{{R.java}}}.
 * Added goals {{{deploy-file}}} and {{{undeploy-file}}} for (un)deploying any separate apk outside of any project.
 * Added goal {{{undeploy-packageName}}} for undeploying an apk from device, if you already know the package name.
 * Config parameter platformtestrunner class can be inferred from {{{AndroidManifest.xml: /manifest//instrumentation/@android:name}}}.
 * Standalone goals should not require a project.
 * Doesn't expect PATH to be set too. Uses ANDROID_SDK/tools instead.
 * Set up release management procedures to enable frequent releases.
 * Started preparing for syncing to Maven Central, so we won't need to specify {{{<pluginRepository>}}} in the pom.xml when it's set up.
