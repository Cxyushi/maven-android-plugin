==Samples are not here==

 * Looking for samples?
 * Want to create Android applications with Maven?
 ** This "Source" page is *not* the place.

Go to --> [Samples] page instead :)

<br/>
==Source code of the plugin itself...==

=What is this not?=

This source code page is only useful for developers of the android-maven-plugin, and for those who develop and maintain the samples.

All Android *application developers* (who want to copy and *use* the samples), please go to the [Samples] page instead, where you will get a version of the samples source code which use a released version of the android-maven-plugin.

--> [Samples] <-- Application developers, go there now

Plugin developers, continue reading...

==This source code==

The code on this page (Source) refers to the latest unreleased version. So if you are looking to use the samples' configuration as an example of how to set up an Android Maven application, don't use the version which you will get by clicking the links here. Instead, see the [Samples] page.

==Get the code!==

See this project's github pages:

 http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin<br/>
 http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin-samples

You can browse the source code there, and even download a zip with the source code! As you can see, the plugin itself is split up from the samples. They are in separate git repositories for technical release reasons.

If you think you will want to edit something, fork the project on Github, and clone your own fork to your development machine, instead of cloning directly from the readonly jayway/maven-android-plugin repo.

==Configure your git correctly for contributions==

We accept only code contributions with LF as line-endings.

You can set up git to convert CRLF/LF automatically. According to the book [http://progit.org/book/ch7-1.html#coreautocrlf Pro Git chapter 7], set it up like this:
=== ...on Windows ===
{{{
git config --global core.autocrlf true
}}}
=== ...on Linux / Mac ===
{{{
git config --global core.autocrlf input
}}}

==Code Conventions==

We have few conventions and are pretty lax about it but we do have some best practice documented on CodeConventions

==Work on the right branch!==

Work happens on separate issue branches, which are branched off of the master branch.

For example, if you are fixing Issue 1234, create a separate branch for that, based on the master branch. Like this:

{{{
git checkout master
git checkout -b issue-1234
}}}

This is especially important to be able to create good Pull Requests (see below).

==Submit!==

===Via github===

Anybody can join in!

And anybody can submit code through github!

1. Go to http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin and fork the project. Forking a source code repository is sooo easy on github!

2. Do your changes in your fork of the project, on a separate branch (see above), otherwise things may get screwed up,

3. Ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality by running the samples project build.

4. then click "Pull Request" on your repository to tell us there are changes to bring in.

===Sending patches===
You may of course also send patches directly through the [http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/issues/list Issue tracker] or mailing list [http://groups.google.com/group/maven-android-developers Maven Android Developers]. However, pull requests sent via github are merged first.
