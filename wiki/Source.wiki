=Source code management=
Git is used instead of Subversion for managing the source code.

==Read Access==

To check out a copy of the source code for yourself:

{{{
 git clone git://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin.git
}}}

...or head on over to [http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin], where you can browse the source code and learn more about Git. You can also download a zip with the source code there.


==Commit Access==

===Via github===
The preferred way to submit code is through github. Go to http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin and fork the project. Do your changes in your clone of the project, then click "pull request" on your repository to tell us there are changes to bring in.

===Sending patches===
You may of course also send patches directly through the [http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/issues/list Issue tracker] or mailing list [http://groups.google.com/group/maven-android-developers Maven Android Developers].
