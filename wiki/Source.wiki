=Source code management=
Git is used instead of Subversion for managing the source code, [http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/ for several reasons].

==Read Access==

To check out a copy of the source code for yourself:

{{{
 git clone git://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin.git
}}}

Or see this project's github page:

 http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin


You can browse the source code there, and even download a zip with the source code.

To learn more about Git, see for example http://github.com/.
