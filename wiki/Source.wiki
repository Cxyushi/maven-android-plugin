==Samples are not here==

 * Looking for samples?
 * Want to create Android applications with Maven?
 ** This "Source" page is *not* the place.

Go to --> [Samples] page instead :)

<br/>
==Source code of the plugin itself...==
...is further down on this page. Continue scrolling...

=What is this?=

This source code page is only useful for developers of the maven-android-plugin, and for those who develop and maintain the samples.

All Android application developers (who want to copy and *use* the samples), please go to the [Samples] page instead, where you will get a version of the samples source code which use a released version of the maven-android-plugin.

--> [Samples] <-- go there now

==This source code==

We use Git instead of Subversion for managing the source code, [http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/ for several reasons].

The code on this page (Source) refers to the "master" version, which in git lingo means the very latest code (a.k.a. "trunk"). The "master" samples version requires the "master" version of the plugin.

So if you are looking to use the samples' configuration as an example of how to set up an Android Maven application, don't use the "master" version which you will get by clicking the links here. Instead, see the [Samples] page.


==Read Access==

To check out a copy of the plugin's source code for yourself:

{{{
 git clone git://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin.git
 git clone git://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin-samples.git
}}}

Or see this project's github pages:

 http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin<br/>
 http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin-samples


You can browse the source code there, and even download a zip with the source code! As you can see, the plugin itself is split up from the samples. They are in separate git repositories for technical release reasons.

To learn more about Git, see for example http://github.com/.
