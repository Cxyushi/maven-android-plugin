=Source code management=
We use Git instead of Subversion for managing the source code, [http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/ for several reasons].

==Read Access==

To check out a copy of the source code for yourself:

{{{
 git clone git://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin.git
 git clone git://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin-samples.git
}}}

Or see this project's github pages:

 http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin<br/>
 http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin-samples


You can browse the source code there, and even download a zip with the source code! As you can see, the plugin itself is split up from the samples. They are in separate git repositories for technical release reasons.

To learn more about Git, see for example http://github.com/.

=== Correct version? ===

These source code links are only useful for developers of the maven-android-plugin and developers of the samples. For users of the plugin (i.e. Android application developers), please go to the [Samples] page instead, where you will get a version of the samples which use a released version of the maven-android-plugin.

The code on this page (Source) refers to the "master" version, which in git lingo means the very latest code (a.k.a. "trunk"). The "master" samples version requires the "master" version of the plugin.

So if you are looking to use the samples' configuration as an example of how to set up an Android Maven application, don't use the "master" version which you will get by clicking the links here. Instead, see the [Samples] page.


==Commit Access==

===Via github===

Anybody can join in!

And anybody can submit code through github!

1. Go to http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin and fork the project. Forking a source code repository is sooo easy on github!

2. Do your changes in your clone of the project,

3. then click "pull request" on your repository to tell us there are changes to bring in.

===Sending patches===
You may of course also send patches directly through the [http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/issues/list Issue tracker] or mailing list [http://groups.google.com/group/maven-android-developers Maven Android Developers].
