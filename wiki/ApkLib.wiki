#summary Android Library Project with apklib packaging type

= Introduction =

Support for Android library projects has been the number 1 most starred issue (Issue 96) for a long time. There is support for it in maven-android-plugin version 2.9.0-beta-1. It's beta because we want to test it more before official release.

Please try it out:

{{{
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.jayway.maven.plugins.android.generation2</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-android-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.0-beta-1</version>
</plugin>

}}}

File any issues in the issue tracker.

= Details =

This beta release can be used just like any other release on Maven Central, without compiling maven-android-plugin from source.

In the maven-android-plugin-samples branch named 'beta', there are also some new samples which use the beta version of the plugin:
https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin-samples/tree/beta/libraryprojects

Those samples do not include any aidl testing, so please test aidl files and report both issues and any success.

The generated {{{.apklib}}} file will have the layout of a standard Android/Eclipse library project. This means that regardless of your Maven layout, the layout inside the {{{.apklib}}} file will be that source code is in "src/" instead of "src/main/java/". This is to be compatible with non-Maven developers' library projects, which important to grow the community. It means we can take any external Android library project zip file (from non-Maven developers) and do {{{mvn install:install-file ...}}} on it and simply start using it as a dependency.
