#summary Android Library Project with apklib packaging type
#labels HowTo,APKLIB

= Introduction =

An Android Library Project is a project intended for inclusion in other Android applications, rather than being run on its own. It is documented more in detail in the official Android developers guide:
 * [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-cmdline.html#SettingUpLibraryProject Android Library Projects on command line]
 * [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html#SettingUpLibraryProject Android Library Projects in Eclipse]

This deprecates ApkSourcesDependency.

*Note:* Maven also supports plain old jar files as libraries for android. Depending on your needs this might be the simpler solution.

= Help test this =

Support for Android library projects in Android Maven Plugin was our number 1 most starred issue (Issue 96) for a long time. There is support for it from version 2.9.0-beta-1 and onwards.

Please try it out:

{{{
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.jayway.maven.plugins.android.generation2</groupId>
    <artifactId>android-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</plugin>

== Compatible with non-Maven Android Library Projects! ==

The generated {{{.apklib}}} file will have the layout of a standard Android/Eclipse library project. This means that regardless of your Maven layout, the layout inside the {{{.apklib}}} file will be that source code is in "src/" instead of "src/main/java/", but still interpreted correctly when used in an Android/Maven application project. This is to be compatible with non-Maven developers' library projects, which is important to grow the Android developer community.

=== Use other non-Maven developers' libraries ===

It also means we can take any external Android library project zip file (from non-Maven developers) and do {{{mvn install:install-file ...}}} on it and simply start using it as a dependency.

=== Share your {{{.apklib}}} with non-Maven developers ===

To share your {{{.apklib}}} file with a non-Maven developer, they will probably feel more comfortable if you rename it to {{{.zip}}}. They can then simply unpack it in a directory and use it from there.
