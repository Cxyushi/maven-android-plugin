= Getting Started =

== Setup your development environment ==
  # Install Sun JDK 1.5+
  # Install latest Android SDK (currently 2.0.1)
     http://developer.android.com/
  # Download the maven-android-sdk-deployer from http://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer/archives/master , extract the file to any folder and follow the instructions in the README file
  # Set environment variable ANDROID_SDK_xx to the path of your installed Android SDK, 
where xx is replaced with 
  # If you look in the pom.xml of the samples`*` project you will find the following dependency.

{{{
  <dependency>
    <groupId>android</groupId>
    <artifactId>android</artifactId>
    <version>1.5_r3</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
}}}

Use one these depending on the platform version you are developing against.

== Optional: Test your development environment ==

If you want to test your environment, download and run the [Samples]`*`.

== Create your own Android application (apk) ==
  # Create a project using the {{{android}}} tool:
     * http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/other-ide.html#CreatingAProject
  # Create a {{{pom.xml}}} in your project, using the sample {{{apidemos-15/apidemos-15-app/pom.xml}}} as template. (See [Samples]`*`.)
     * Make these changes:
     * Remove the entire {{{<parent>}}} tag.
     * Change {{{<groupId>}}}, {{{<artifactId>}}} and {{{<name>}}} to your own. (Some tips: [http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html Maven - Guide to Naming Conventions])
  # Rename, and move the source directory to where Maven expects it:
     {{{
     mv src java
     mkdir -p src/main
     mv java src/main/
     }}}

     or if you don't want to change the directory structure, just add "sourceDirectory
{{{
    <build>
    ......
    <sourceDirectory>src</sourceDirectory> 
    </build>
}}} 

     to pom.xml.

  # You won't need these files/directories with Maven Android Plugin, so you can remove them:
     {{{
     rm -r bin build.xml build.properties libs
     }}}
     _The {{{default.properties}}} file is currently not used by Maven Android Plugin, but will be, so leave that in place for now. {{{default.properties}}} and the {{{gen}}} folder are used by the ADT plugin in Eclipse, if you use that._<br/>
     _(Also leave the "test" folder for now. You can later move it out to its own project. If you want, you can then look at the {{{apidemos-15-instrumentationtest}}} sample project.)_
  # To build your apk, simply:
     {{{
     mvn install
     }}}
  # To deploy your apk to the connected device:
     {{{
     mvn com.jayway.maven.plugins.android.generation2:maven-android-plugin:deploy
     }}}

<sup><i>Do you think that last Maven command was long? It was. Check out [TipsAndTricks].</i></sup>

== Run instrumentation tests on device ==
Check out the {{{apidemos-15-instrumentationtest}}} project in [Samples]`*`.

You can create a project like that, by moving your "test" folder out and renaming it to for example "myproject-instrumentationtest". Then rearrange the folders within it like above, and use the {{{pom.xml}}} from {{{apidemos-15-instrumentationtest}}} as template.
  

== More documentation ==

There is some more documentation on the [Documentation] page.
<br/>
=== (`*`) Samples===
Always use the version of samples linked from the [Samples] page, so that you get a usable version of its configuration.
