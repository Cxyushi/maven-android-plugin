== Maven Repository ==

Temporarily, until we have set up automatic deployment to Maven Central repository, you need to configure your pom.xml to use our Maven Repository:

{{{
  <pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
      <id>maven-android-plugin-m2repo.googlecode.com</id>
      <name>Maven Android Plugin Release Repository</name>
      <url>http://maven-android-plugin-m2repo.googlecode.com/svn/release</url>
    </pluginRepository>
  </pluginRepositories>
}}}

== version 2 README.txt ==

See the [http://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin/tree/master maven-android-plugin 2.x README.txt]. (scroll to the bottom of that page to see the README.)

It will tell you about how to create your own Maven project for an Android application. When it comes to the "samples" referenced in the README, you can get them by clicking the "download" button at the top of the README page.

=== version 2 alpha/beta status ===

You can see which versions of maven-android-plugin version 2.x are released in [http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin-m2repo/source/browse/#svn/release/com/jayway/maven/plugins/android/generation2/maven-android-plugin our Maven Repository].

Currently we're in alpha status. This does not imply "bad quality code" in any way :) but rather means we have not decided on all names of goals and parameters. When maven-android-plugin 2.0.0-beta1 is released, all names of goals and parameters are finalized for all versions 2.x. Please help decide on good names for goals and parameters, by commenting on them on [http://groups.google.com/group/maven-android-developers Maven Android Developers]! There is some documentation of plugin goals and parameters on the [http://maven-android-plugin-m2site.googlecode.com/svn/plugin-info.html automatically generated maven site].
